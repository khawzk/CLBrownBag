# CLBrownBag

This repository contains 2 Python projects:
1. A demo for web scraping, demonstrating how to crawl data from websites.
2. Sentiment analysis using two techniques: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) - Bag of Words Approach, and a pretrained Roberta model from Hugging Face.

## Project Overview:
- The main analysis is performed in the Jupyter Notebook `sentiment-analysis-python.ipynb`.
- If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can access the notebook using the following links:
    - [View on nbviewer (Scrapy WEB Scraper)](https://nbviewer.org/github/khawzk/CLBrownBag/blob/main/scrapy_from_jnb.ipynb)
    - [View on nbviewer (VADER and Roberta)](https://nbviewer.org/github/khawzk/CLBrownBag/blob/main/sentiment-analysis-python-roberta.ipynb)

## Usage:
- The project involves sentiment analysis on a dataset of Amazon reviews using VADER and Roberta.
- If needed, modify the file paths in the code to match your system configuration.
- The results, plots, and analysis are presented in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Contributions and Feedback:
- Feel free to contribute to the project or provide any feedback to improve the analysis.

Thank you!
