    "1. **Install Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda:**\n",
    "   - Download and install Anaconda from the official website (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).\n",
    "   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.\n",
    "   - Open the Anaconda Navigator application after installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "   - In Anaconda Navigator, click on \"Launch\" under the Jupyter Notebook icon.\n",
    "   - A new tab will open in your web browser, showing the Jupyter Notebook dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a New Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "   - Click on \"New\" and select \"Python 3\" to create a new Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Install Scrapy via pip:**\n",
    "   - Inside the newly created Jupyter Notebook cell, type `!pip install scrapy` and press Shift + Enter.\n",
    "   - Scrapy will be installed in your Jupyter environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have Jupyter Notebook installed and can use Scrapy to scrape websites directly from your Jupyter environment. Happy coding!\n"
